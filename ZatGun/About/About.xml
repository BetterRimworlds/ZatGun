    <description>This is a real Zat Gun (Zat'nik'tel), from the Stargate Universe. One shot stuns. Two shots kills. Rumors about the third shot are greatly exaggerated.
        
This is the perfect weapon for penal colonies, mental breaks etc. The pawn will be downed for several seconds (with minimal injuries), easily allowing capture. The risk of death is the equivalent to a single charge rifle bullet hitting them.
